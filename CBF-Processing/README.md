### Overview  

The codes in this folder are used to perform CBF quantification. 

You will need the following files obtained in the previous step (see [Data-Processing](https://github.com/hgresseau/ASL-Processing/tree/8194ae3b1ac7266898ea987851f34b8212ccb33b/Processing)):
- 

The codes in this folder serve as examples. You must replace the file names with the ones you have, and adjust to your directories/paths.

#### Tools needed üí°
- MATLAB
- NIfTI_tools*

*Note: For students in Dr. Gauthier's lab, ask Dr. Gauthier for more details, including access.

# CBF Quantification

**6Ô∏è‚É£ [Running BASIL for Perfusion Estimation](https://github.com/hgresseau/ASL-Processing/blob/69b096b433d934f680490dc41f1ef2ad9eb7b690/CBF-Processing/8_CBF_processing.m)**

- **BASIL** (Bayesian Inference for Arterial Spin Labeling) is used for modeling and estimating perfusion maps.
- There is the line in the main processing script ([8_CBF_processing.m](https://github.com/hgresseau/ASL-Processing/blob/e4d58e6e54508e27a61a5bd297cbf52b82a56be4/CBF-Processing/8_CBF_processing.m)) that contains a BASIL command. Run it using the subtracted image from the [previous step](https://github.com/hgresseau/ASL-Processing/tree/e492dabf22fcca6ea994a2aecf7660052a0bfc57/Preprocessing):
  - Note: make sure you put all negative voxels equals to zero in the subtracted image
- Create a ***params.txt*** file for BASIL containing the imaging parameters and the number of volumes in the subtracted image. >>>>>> EXPLAIN HOW TO CREATE THOSE PARAMS.TXT FILES!!!
- Full instructions for running BASIL are available in the documentation and code provided.
- The output of BASIL will be the **perfusion-weighted image**.

CBF quantification involves a straightforward calculation using the output from BASIL and a calibration image:

**A. Required Inputs**
1. **Perfusion Image**: Generated from BASIL.
2. **M0 Scan** (Calibration Image):
  - The M0 scan is a single-volume calibration scan used for absolute quantification.
  - The only preprocessing step needed is **brain extraction (BET)**.

**B. Applying the CBF Formula**
- Use the provided formula in the shared code to compute the CBF map.
- Inputs: **Perfusion Image + Brain-extracted M0 Scan**
- Save the computed **[CBF Map](https://github.com/hgresseau/ASL-Processing/blob/bea8d59a7def6a836afd4f884ab7484c21f87947/CBF-Processing/9_CBF_map.m)** for further analysis.
